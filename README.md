# Ponycountdown API

Recommended usage is to request and store the full list of episodes, and periodically check for changes.
The /until endpoints are now deprecated, these will be removed soon to allow better caching.

###Format
Responses are in JSON format, unless a ?callback parameter is supplied, which will provide a JSONP response.

    http://api.ponycountdown.com/ will give a plain JSON response, [...]  

    http://api.ponycountdown.com?callback=JSON_CALLBACK will wrap the response as JSON_CALLBACK([...]);
